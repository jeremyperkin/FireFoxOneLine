Firefox CSS customization - current v.75

Included is my userContent.css file.  Which modifies a few pages like, google.com. youtube.com and more.

uBlock Origin Extension has been modified with my colour scheme as well.  Ensure to change the UUID to yours if you wish to use it.
about:debugging > this Firefox > uBlock Origin UUID > copy that number and replace the one used in userContent.css.

All colour info is available in colors.css - uBo colours has it's own section which you can choose to modify.  Created nord.css which can be changed to make swapping colour scheme easier or you can choose to make your own theme.   If you make a new file make sure to import it into colors.css.  (Currently it is set to nord.css) Just follow same logic if you change anything.

Feel free to fork and change things as you wish - Maybe we can work on this together.
